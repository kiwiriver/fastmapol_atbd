# FastMAPOL ATBD in a Nutshell

Authors: Meng Gao, Kirk Knobelspiesse, Pengwang Zhai, Kamal Aryal, Bryan Franz, Jeremy Werdell


## Introduction

## Algorithm Description
FastMAPOL optimizes the least squares difference between a forward model and Multi-Angular Polarimeter (MAP) data using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The retrieval parameters are listed below in the data products section. The forward model is built using neural networks, based on training dataset generated by a radiative transfer model. We describe each components of the algorithm below.
### Forward model
- Radiative transfer model
The Radiative Transer model is based on the Successive Order of Scattering (RTSOS) method (Zhai et al., 2009, 2010). RTSOS is capable of solving polarized radiative transfer for both atmosphere-ocean and atmosphere-land systems. In atmosphere-ocean systems, it can also simulate inelastic scattering processes, including Raman scattering and fluorescence by chlorophyll and colored dissolved organic matter (Zhai et al., 2015, 2017, 2018). An improved pseudos-spherical shell (IPSS) algorithm is used to improve the simulation of radiance field over polar regions (Zhai and Hu, 2022). For this work, RTSOS is configured to simulate polarized radiance field for randomly generated Earth systems for the PACE instruments (Zhai et al, 2022). The data is then used to train a neural network, which emulates the behavior of the radiative transfer system.

## Data products
PACE FastMAPOL polarimeter L2 products include four data groups:

- geolocation_data
- geophysical_data
- diagnostic_data
- sensor_band_parameters

### geophysical_data group: aerosol and surface products
Aerosol optical properties for both fine and coarse modes:

- Aerosol optical depth (aot and aot_fine/coarse)
- Aerosol single scattering albedo (ssa and ssa_fine/coarse)
- Ångström coefficient (angstrom_440_870 and angstrom_440_670)
- Aerosol fine mode optical depth fraction (fmf)

Aerosol microphysical properties:

- Aerosol effective radius (reff_fine/coarse) and variance (veff_fine/coarse)
- Aerosol refractive index: real part (mr and mr_fine/coarse), imaginary part (mi and mi_fine/coarse)
- Aerosol spherical fraction (sph and sph_fine/coarse)
- Aerosol volume density (vd_fine/coarse)
- Aerosol fine mode volume fraction (fvf)
- Aerosol layer height (alh)

Surface and ocean products:

- Wind speed (wind_speed)
- Chlorophyll-a (chla)
- Remote sensing reflectance (Rrs*)

The remote sensing reflectance characterizes ocean-leaving reflectance. It is derived via atmospheric correction based on the retrieved aerosol properties at all HARP2 viewing angles. Therefore, it includes an angle dimension, as in the L1C data. There are two versions of remote sensing reflectance: Rrs1 (before BRDF correction) and Rrs2 (after BRDF correction). Due to the large size of Rrs1 and Rrs2, they are optional outputs in the standard L2 file. Instead, their angular means and standard deviations are typically included as Rrs1_mean/std and Rrs2_mean/std.

### diagnostic_data: data quality evaluations
Since the retrieval algorithm is based on optimal estimation by minimizing a $\chi^2$ cost function defined as the difference between measurement (m) and forward model fitting (f), normalized by total uncertainties ($\sigma$).

$\chi^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum (f - m)^2/\sigma^2$

Here N is the total number of measureents used in retreival. The algorithm also adaptively evalue fitting performance, if the fitting perform poor, it will be removed from the retreival process. Therefore, the $\chi^2$ and $N$ can be used to evaluate retrieval performance, the pixels with small $\chi^2$ (good fitting) and large $N$ (more pixels can be fitted) will better quality. A more quantitatively approach based on error propogation can be also used to compute retrieval uncertainty, which will be include in future product.

To support L3 data processing, a quality flag is also defined, which is usually based on $\chi^2$ and $N$. For the HARP2 test data, currently we choose
- quality_flag = 0: when $\chi^2<1.5$ and $N_{ref}>60$ and $N_{DoLP}>60$
- quality_flag = 1: when $\chi^2<1.5$ and $N_{ref}>40$ and $N_{DoLP}>40$
- quality_flag > 1: for higher value $\chi^2$ and lower values of $N_{ref}$ and $N_{DoLP}$
Quality flag will be updated with future L1 data calibration improvement.
